# Navigation Improvements

## Back Button Implementation

### Overview
Added back button functionality to both SignUp and Login screens to improve user experience and navigation flow.

### Changes Made

#### SignUpScreen
- Added `TouchableOpacity` import
- Created styled components for back button:
  - `BackButtonContainer`: Positioned absolutely at top-left
  - `BackButton`: Circular button with glassmorphism effect
  - `BackButtonText`: Styled text with arrow symbol
- Positioned back button outside main container for proper layering
- Uses `navigation.goBack()` for consistent navigation behavior

#### LoginScreen
- Applied identical back button implementation as SignUpScreen
- Maintains consistent UI/UX across authentication screens
- Same positioning and styling for visual consistency

### Technical Details
- **Position**: Top-left corner (60px from top, 24px from left)
- **Styling**: Glassmorphic effect with semi-transparent background
- **Icon**: Arrow symbol (‚Üê) for intuitive navigation
- **Functionality**: Uses React Navigation's `goBack()` method
- **Z-index**: Set to 10 to ensure button appears above other content

### User Experience
- Users can now easily navigate back to the Welcome screen from both SignUp and Login pages
- Consistent back button placement across authentication flow
- Maintains the app's glassmorphic design language
- Improves overall navigation usability
